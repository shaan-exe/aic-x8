# AIC X8 - Welcome to the Repo - Vue Template
## A starter template for a Vue.js exercise using the Options API

Clone this repository for a new Vue project with Single File Components (.vue files). These require a build step, so make sure you are running on a Node.js environment.

Open VS Code's integrated terminal in the `vue-app` folder. (Easiest to just right-click on the folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal".) Then enter the following commands:

`npm install`  
`npm run dev`

This will spin up a server running your Vue app on your local machine. Ctrl+click or navigate to the URL shown in the terminal to view your page, live updates, and the Vue debugger.

All of your Vue coding will be done in the `src` folder, but remember to give your page a real title in `index.html`, found in the `vue-app` root folder.
